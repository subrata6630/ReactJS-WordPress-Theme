## R2D2 React WordPress Theme

WordPress theme project built with Yarn, Webpack, BrowserSync and React.

See the working example: [www.wpr2d2.com](http://wpr2d2.com/)

### Getting started

1.  Clone repo to your `wp-content/themes` folder
1.  In `config.json` change the `proxyURL` to point to your WordPress dev url.
1.  Activate the theme in wp-admin
1.  `cd` into your checked out folder and run `yarn`
1.  Run `yarn start` to get Webpack and BrowserSync running

To build for production run:

`yarn build`

A production-ready React `bundle.js` file will be written to `dist/bundle.js`.

### Road Map

* Support for admin bar
* Custom post type support
* Custom taxonomy support
* Death Star :)
